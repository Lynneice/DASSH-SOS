        "*   **Environment Setup**: All necessary libraries (NLTK, SpaCy, Transformers, Gensim, Python-Levenshtein, Pandas, NumPy) and language models (`en_core_web_sm` for SpaCy, 'punkt', 'vader\\_lexicon', 'punkt\\_tab' for NLTK) were successfully installed and loaded.\n",
        "*   **Transcript Parsing**: A `load_chat_transcript` function was developed to parse raw chat transcripts, accurately distinguishing between 'Visitor' and 'Agent' messages, and preserving punctuation.\n",
        "*   **Visitor Query Identification**: A `identify_visitor_queries` function was implemented to classify visitor sentences. It successfully identified \"definite queries\" (e.g., \"What is the status of order \\#12345?\") which start with interrogative words and end with a question mark.\n",
        "*   **PII Masking**: The `mask_pii` function, leveraging SpaCy's Named Entity Recognition, successfully masked Personal Identifiable Information like names (\"John Doe\") and numerical entities (\"35\" or \"12345\") with a `[MASKED_PII]` placeholder.\n",
        "*   **Profanity Detection**: A `detect_profanity` function was created, using a pre-defined lexicon, to assign a vulgarity score (0-1). It correctly identified profanity in sample texts, yielding scores like 0.17 or 0.25 for profane sentences, and 0.00 for clean ones.\n",
        "*   **Topic Modeling (LDA)**: An LDA model was trained with 3 topics on 5 preprocessed visitor queries, using a dictionary of 9 unique tokens. The dominant topic was assigned to each query, and the model achieved a coherence score (c\\_v) of 0.5060, indicating moderate topic quality given the small dataset.\n",
        "*   **Query Grouping**: The `get_most_similar_query_group` function was implemented to group similar queries based on Levenshtein distance and calculate occurrences. While the function was correctly implemented, the small sample dataset provided was too distinct, leading to each query forming its own group with an occurrence count of 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The implemented modules provide a robust pipeline for chat transcript analysis, covering essential aspects from PII masking to sentiment and topic identification.\n",
        "*   To fully leverage the query grouping functionality, further testing with a larger and more varied dataset containing genuinely similar visitor queries is recommended to fine-tune the Levenshtein distance threshold and validate the `occurrences` calculation.\n"
